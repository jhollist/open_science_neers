Open science encompasses many concepts, but most agree that for science to be truly open four things must be true. First, all components of the scientific project must be freely available including manuscripts, code, and data.  Second, others must be able to repeat your work and reproduce the results.  Third, open science is a product of the internet age and thus needs to be web enabled.  Lastly, open science happens as part of a process, not an event.  In this talk, I will address each of these components, but will do so from my own perspective. I will discuss how I have progressively opened up my science, the benefits to doing that, and describe the tools I have used.  In this last part, I will focus on the importance of the web, in particular social media, and how I have used open source geospatial tools.  My goals for this talk are to use my evolution into an open science zealot as a means to motivate others to begin utilizing these same tools in their own research.
